{% blocktrans %}  <p>Pages are user-written articles on a range of subjects. Any contributor or a group of contributors can create (and own) new articles, and there can be multiple articles on the same topic, each written by a different author. </p>
  <h6>Who can make a page?</h6>
  <p> Anyone with an account can create a new article. When creating a new article, the initial contributor can choose to have a defined list of authors, all of whom can edit the page, or have an open, wiki-like format where anyone can contribute.  </p>
