The Connected Learning Initiative (CLIx) is a technology enabled initiative at scale for high school students. The initiative was seeded by Tata Trusts, Mumbai and is led by Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA USA. CLIx offers a scalable and sustainable model of open education, to meet the educational needs of students and teachers. The initiative has won UNESCO’s prestigious 2017 King Hamad Bin Isa Al-Khalifa Prize, for the Use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the field of Education.<br />
<br />
CLIx incorporates thoughtful pedagogical design and leverages contemporary technology and online capabilities. Resources for students are in the areas of Mathematics, Sciences, Communicative English and Digital Literacy, designed to be interactive, foster collaboration and integrate values and 21st century skills. These are being offered to students of government secondary schools in Chhattisgarh, Mizoram, Rajasthan and Telangana in their regional languages and also released as Open Educational Resources (OERs).<br />
<br />
Teacher Professional Development is available through professional communities of practice and the blended Post Graduate Certificate in Reflective Teaching with ICT. Through research and collaborations, CLIx seeks to nurture a vibrant ecosystem of partnerships and innovation to improve schooling for underserved communities.<br />
