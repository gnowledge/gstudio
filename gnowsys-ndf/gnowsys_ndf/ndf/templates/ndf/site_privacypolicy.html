<br />
<a name="6">USE FOR PERSONALIZATION AND PEDAGOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS</a><br />
Our goal is to provide current and future visitors with the best possible educational experience. To further this goal, we sometimes present different users with different versions &amp; adaptations of the course materials and software. We do this to personalize the experience to the individual learner (assess the learner's level of ability and learning style, and present materials best suited to the learner), to evaluate the effectiveness of our course materials, to improve our understanding of the learning process and to otherwise improve the effectiveness of our offerings. We may publish or otherwise publicize results from this process, but, unless otherwise permitted under this Privacy Policy, those publications or public disclosures will not include Personal Information.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="7">SECURITY</a><br />
CLIx has a policy designed to protect Personal Information in its possession or control. This is done through a variety of privacy and security policies, processes, and procedures, including administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Personal Information that it creates, receives, maintains, or transmits. Nonetheless, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure; and therefore, CLIx cannot guarantee its absolute security.<br />
