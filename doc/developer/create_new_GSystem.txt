Create New GSystem

1.The new GSystem can be create from the Admin Designer tab.

    1.1. The user is required to select a GSystemType depending on which a corressponding GSystem template would be loaded.

    1.2. Here there are two possible cases:
        1.2.1. If the GSystemType select, has its own .html page (eg. The GSystemType Page has its own
                page.html ) then that page would be loaded.
        1.2.2. If the GSystemType selected does not have its own .html page,then a dynamic
                page is loaded having the fields based on :
                1.2.2.1. attribute_type_set of the GSystemType selected
                1.2.2.2. relation_type_set of the GSystemType selected
                1.2.2.3. get_possible_attributes of the GSystemType selected, fetched by using the
                         method in models.py
                1.2.2.4. get_possible_relations of the GSystemType selected, fetched by using the
                         method in models.py
                (NOTE: In case, there is any duplicity between  attribute_type_set and get_possible_attributes, then the duplicate fields from get_possible_attributed are removed.)
                1.2.2.5. Default fields of GSystem class.

    1.3. After the form is saved, the corressponding GAttribute's and GRelation's are added.

2. The form saved can be edited from the admin/data/GSystem or admin/designer/GSystem drawer.

3. The Graphs: Concept Graph, Collection Graph, Dependency Graph can be viewed from admin/data/GSystem
    and admin/designer/GSystem drawer.
