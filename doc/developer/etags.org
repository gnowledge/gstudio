* Using etags for maintaining consistency of names across the project				:dev:

This is useful tip for those of you who use Emacs for your development. 
We recommend to use etags to search and replace expressions across the
project.  This helps to keep the entire project consistent.

Aggregate the files from your project that you normally edit. These
are my files.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
find gnowsys-ndf/ -name "*.py" -print >> files
find gnowsys-ndf/ -name "*.html" -print >> files
find gnowsys-ndf/ -name "*.css" -print >> files
find gnowsys-ndf/ -name "*.scss" -print >> files
find gnowsys-ndf/ -name "*.org" -print >> files
find doc/ -name "*.org" -print >> files
#+END_EXAMPLE

generate TAGS file by the following command: 

cat files | etags -

You will see a new file in the project directory called 'TAGS'. 

While editing your project, use "M-x tags-search" or "M-x
tags-query-replace" to do your work in Emacs.
