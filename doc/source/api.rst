API
===

Providing version 1 ( ``v1`` ) API for gStudio, built with native python methods and mongo queries. In next version 2 ( ``v2`` ), we will be having comprehensive API's built on top of *Elastic-Search*.

**Glossary:** 1. Workspace: - Workspace is where all nodes get
published. Every node must have one or more workspace IDs in their
property named 'group\_set'. The default workspace of gStudio is 'home'.

2. Resource Type:

   -  Resource type are different types of resources (published as
      Nodes) which exist in gStudio. Most common default Resource Types
      are 'Page', 'File', 'Event', 'Course' etc. Every node published in
      gStudio will have reference to Workspace and Resource Type. That
      is how we know how a node is typed (object of which type) and
      where (in which workspace) it is published.

3. Resource:

   -  Resource is actual nodes of the respository. Each resource is
      described with fields specified below. Resources are published
      under atleast one workspace and are a member of a Resource Type.
      Common examples of Resource Types are: *Page* or *File*. The
      reference to Resource Type can be read from the field
      \`member\_of.

--------------

**Resource Fields** - "\_id"*: a UUID (Primary Key) auto generated by
mongoDB. - "name"*: Name of resource. Short concise, Mostly unique.
Uniqueness is maintained only for each Workspace, and for each Resource
Type. - "altnames": Display Name. It can be elaborative, long. It is
recommended that UI will use this value when present. - "language"\*:
Language code in ISO 639-2 standard. (e.g: ["hi", "Hindi"]) - "content":
Description/content of resource. - "if\_file": Contains information of
media urls in nested dictionary. Following is schema of if\_file:

.. raw:: html

   <PRE>
       {
           'mime_type': <MIME type of resource>,
           'original': {'id': <Id>, 'relurl': <relative url of media file>},
           'mid': {'id': <Id>, 'relurl': <relative url of media file>},
           'thumbnail': {'id': <Id>, 'relurl': <relative url of media file>}

    - mime_type: Indicates MIME type of resource, mostly filled if the resource is a file.
    - original: URL of original/uploaded file resource.
    - mid: URL of mid/converted form of original file. This can be mid-size image for images and `.webm` for videos. Blank for other resource types. 
    - thumbnail: Thumbnail of uploaded resource (mostly it's available for images and videos).
    - *NOTE: URL's are relative urls of site. Prepend relative value with `<domain>/media/`*

        <PRE>
        {

Relation support:
- Check for field `relation_set` in every object. It contains dict of relation-name (key) and ObjectId or [ObjectId] as value.
- We can derive full object with `//<domain>/api/v1?_id=<ObjectId>` API call.
- Example: To list out the topic ("Patterns and Symmetry"): https://nroer.gov.in/api/v1?resource_type=Topic&name=Patterns%20and%20Symmetry
- To get detail about one object of taught_by: https://nroer.gov.in/api/v1?_id=5af1810816b51c01e3736a5c
- NOTE: Get additional/complete details of object: https://nroer.gov.in/dev/query/5af1810816b51c01e3736a5c/nbh
