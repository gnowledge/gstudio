1. Add the list of all objects (wikidata items - the Q id's) to the file gnowsys_ndf/gnowsys_ndf/ndf/static/ndf/wikidata/list_of_objects. A sample list of objects has already been added. You can find the wikidata dump at "http://dumps.wikimedia.org/wikidatawiki/"

2. Run the filldb command:
	
	python manage.py filldb
	
	This helps create the WikiData App on the metastudio website.

3. Run the script iterative_script.(iterative_script.py uses methods defined in the system_script2.py)
	
	python manage.py iterative_script
	
	It takes 3 iterations to complete. 

4. The script called as final_script2.py is a sample script based on DFS based recurive approach.It will work for a small number of objects but the stack will overflow for large number of objects.It uses functions of system_script.py
The script final_script.py is an initial effort based on recursive approach.Both the scripts are useful only for developers(who want to understand and modify the code) and not users.

5. [Debugging] In case of any errors/exceptions, the log of all the 3 iterations will be available after this in the directory - gnowsys_ndf/gnowsys_ndf/ndf/static/ndf/wikidata/
	
	Three files iteration_1.txt, iteration_2.txt, iteration_3.txt will be available for debugging if any errors occur.(iterative_script.py uses log_script.py to create these log files.)

6. [Future Scope]
	a) Add the dependency graph and instance/subclass graph.
	b) Tag Clould
	c) Theme-Topic Hierarchy
	d) Prior Nodes of a particular topic - Take the inputs from the users and prepare prior_nodes of any node. (Research Topic)
	e) Define inverse relationships. We could not define inverse relationship names. As discussed with GN, we have added -in front of <actual-relation-name> as the inverse-name.
