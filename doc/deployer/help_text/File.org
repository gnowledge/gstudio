* Files (Document Library)

  A file is an App for sharing electronic documents of any type with
  the group members.  

  Files can be grouped as collections, both heterogeneous (files of
  different type, say: images, videos and presentations) as well
  homogeneous collections (all images or all videos etc.)

  Presentation of some file types which a browser supports can be
  viewed online.  If the media type of a file is not supported by the
  browser, and browser does not have a plugin to present it, the site
  will provide a download link.

  When a file is already uploaded by another user, the site will
  inform the user that such a file already exists.  If an image is
  uploaded in another group, you may want to cross-publish it in more
  than one group.

  Each file can be rated, discussed and linked to other resources,
  concepts, topics etc. Standard as well as learning resources
  metadata can be set for every file.
