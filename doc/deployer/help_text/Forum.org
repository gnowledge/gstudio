* Forum

  A forum is meant for discussion on any topic related to the
  activities of the group.  Each group can have any number of fora.

  After creating a forum on a broad topic, users can create a *thread*
  on an issue and seek feedback from the members of the group. Each
  thread could have replies that are organized in a nested way to
  visually display the reply pattern.

  Notifications will be sent to members of the group when a new
  thread or a reply is posted.
